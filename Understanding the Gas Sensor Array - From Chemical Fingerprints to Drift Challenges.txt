We have 16 metal oxide sensors, each with different chemical compositions that react differently to various gases. When a gas sample is introduced, all 16 sensors are exposed to it simultaneously, and their combined electrical resistance changes (ΔR) create a unique “fingerprint” pattern - this is what F1_DR captures in the raw data. The other features (F2-F8) are transformations: F2 normalizes the resistance change for comparability across sensors, while F3-F8 are exponential moving averages at different time scales (α=0.001, 0.01, 0.1) capturing how fast sensors respond to gas exposure (EMAi) and how quickly they recover when gas is removed (EMAd). The drift problem occurs because these resistance patterns change over time as sensors age, even for the same gas at the same concentration. The unsupervised learning challenge is to discover patterns in this 128-dimensional space (16 sensors × 8 features) that remain stable enough to identify gases despite this temporal drift.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
