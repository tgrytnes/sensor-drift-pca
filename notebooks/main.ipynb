    "# Geometric Analysis of Sensor Drift\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Introduction and Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project investigates the phenomenon of sensor drift in gas sensor arrays through the lens of **unsupervised learning**, specifically employing **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** as the primary dimensionality reduction technique. The core challenge addresses how chemical sensor measurements, which exist in a 128-dimensional space, change their response patterns over time due to sensor aging and environmental factors—a critical problem in chemical detection systems that affects reliability and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project reframes the traditional calibration problem as a geometric analysis task: understanding how the low-dimensional manifold occupied by chemical signatures transforms over time in high-dimensional measurement space. By applying PCA and related techniques, we aim to identify stable subspaces that remain invariant despite temporal drift, ultimately developing methods for drift correction and improved chemical classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type of Learning and Task\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Paradigm:** Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- No labeled drift patterns are provided; we discover structure from the data itself\n",
    "- Focus on understanding intrinsic data geometry and temporal evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Algorithms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: For dimensionality reduction and identifying dominant variance directions\n",
    "- **Clustering algorithms** (K-means, hierarchical): For grouping chemical signatures\n",
    "- **Procrustes Analysis**: For geometric alignment and drift correction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task Type:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing 128-dimensional sensor readings to a manageable subspace\n",
    "- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying drift patterns as deviations from expected behavior\n",
    "- **Pattern Recognition**: Discovering invariant features across temporal batches\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Goals and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Goal:** To develop a mathematical framework for understanding and correcting sensor drift through principal component analysis, achieving at least a 30% reduction in drift-induced classification errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Industrial Relevance**: Gas sensor arrays are widely used in environmental monitoring, food quality control, and safety systems. Sensor drift causes frequent recalibration needs, increasing operational costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scientific Innovation**: By treating drift as a geometric transformation in PC space rather than noise, we can develop more principled correction methods that preserve chemical signature integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Practical Impact**: A successful drift correction method would extend sensor array lifetime, reduce maintenance requirements, and improve long-term reliability of chemical detection systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specific Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prove that chemical signatures occupy a low-dimensional manifold (5-8 dimensions) within the 128-dimensional measurement space\n",
    "- Quantify the stability of different principal components over 36 months\n",
    "- Develop a mathematical model of drift as geometric transformations\n",
    "- Create a Procrustes-based correction algorithm achieving 67% reduction in drift effects\n",
    "- Validate improvements using multiple clustering quality metrics\n",
    "\n",

    "**Dataset:** Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "**Full Citation:**\n",
    "Vergara, A., Vembu, S., Ayhan, T., Ryan, M. A., Homer, M. L., & Huerta, R. (2012). *Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C5ZS4K\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Description:**\n",
    "The dataset contains measurements from an array of 128 metal oxide gas sensors exposed to six different gaseous substances (Ethanol, Ethylene, Ammonia, Acetaldehyde, Acetone, and Toluene) at various concentrations. Data was collected over 36 months in five distinct batches (months 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20), capturing the natural drift phenomenon as sensors age. Each measurement consists of 128 features representing individual sensor responses, with approximately 13,910 total observations across all batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Collection Method:**\n",
    "Measurements were obtained in a controlled laboratory environment using a standardized gas delivery system. Each batch represents a different time point in the sensor array's lifetime, allowing us to study temporal drift patterns systematically."
